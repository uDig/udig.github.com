<h1>Welcome New Eclipse RCP Developers<a class="headerlink" href="#welcome-new-eclipse-rcp-developers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>If uDig is your first Eclipse RCP project you are in for a bit of a learning wall.</p>
<p>Working with the uDig project will bring together three aspects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The Java Programming Language</li>
<li>Eclipse Rich Client Platform Development</li>
<li>The Geospatial Domain</li>
</ul>
<p>Please understand that it will take some time to become familiar with each of these areas; be kind
to yourself and budget time accordingly. If your team is weak in one or more areas you should
strongly considering purchasing books and budging time for learning (or a training course).</p>
<div class="section" id="training-course">
<h2>Training Course<a class="headerlink" href="#training-course" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The best advice is (of course) contact a Project Steering Committee member for our week long
training course:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://udig.refractions.net/users/">http://udig.refractions.net/users/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are working for an academic institution please have your professor contact us; we can make
our training materials available to you.</p>

<div class="section" id="udig-tutorials">
<h2>uDig Tutorials<a class="headerlink" href="#udig-tutorials" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Other than that please jump on in; the udig-devel email list is a good place to ask questions.
Please go through the &#8220;getting started&#8221; tutorials in the developers guide and ask lots of questions
on the email list and IRC.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">As you go through the tutorials please understand it is not enough <strong>just</strong> to get them
to run - you will need to do all the &#8220;Things to Try&#8221; questions at the end in order to understand how
to turn on tracing, or distribute your custom application to your customers.</p>

<h2>uDig Documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#udig-documentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Developers Guide is structured in the same manner as the Eclipse Documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><a class="reference internal" href="index.html"><em>Index</em></a></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference internal" href="udig_guidelines.html"><em>uDig Guidelines</em></a></li>

<li><a class="reference internal" href="user_interface_guidelines.html"><em>User Interface Guidelines</em></a></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Developers Guide is not complete; or always up to date. The document is contains our notes as we
built the application and were learning the Eclipse RCP environment.</p>
<p>The developers guide does not cover as much scope as much information as our commercial training
materials. In many places you will need to learn by using the debugger to step through functionality
you are interested in.</p>
<p>The extension point documentation and javadoc information can also be of assistance.</p>

<div class="section" id="how-it-fits-together">
<h2>How it fits together<a class="headerlink" href="#how-it-fits-together" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The following notes come from email discussion on the udig-devel list; we will add to this if you
have any additional questions. The concepts here were introduced in the above tutorials.</p>
<div class="section" id="how-plugins-work">
<h3>How plugins work<a class="headerlink" href="#how-plugins-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Eclipse stuff is grouped into plugs for reuse; the plugin definition
has a lot of safety/sanity checks included; with the idea that they
don&#8217;t want to run or include a plugin that won&#8217;t work. So they have
each plugin list what it needs to run; and then the plugin system
checks all this stuff out; and only if it is good does the plugin get
loaded - most of this information is in the MANIFEST.MF file (usually
used to describe a jar in normal java apps).</li>
</ul>
<p>The name of this plugin system is &#8220;OSGi&#8221; - Eclipse 2 used to have its
own but they threw it out and adopted OSGi (and that is the whole
reason for the Eclipse 3.x series). OSGi started out for like cell
phones and stuff so it is very good and loading and unloading stuff an
preventing memory leaks etc... since rebooting a phone is annoying if
you are expecting a phone call. Indeed OSGi is being used to manage
server stuff now as well.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Once the plugin gets loaded the &#8220;Platform&#8221; reads the &#8220;plugin.xml&#8221;
file and &#8220;wires&#8221; the code into the resulting application. As a
developer you can ask the Platform a question (such as what map tools
are defined) and then do something with the answer - such as as make a
toolbar for users to select the current map tool. The eclipse map
editor does this as a toolbar; if you are embeding your own map may
wish to go through the list and do something else (like a drop down
combo box?).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important that the wiring of the application is not magic;
programmers are responsible for asking the Platform questions and
doing something with the result.</p>
<p>As an example the menus are done by the &#8220;org.eclipse.ui&#8221; plugin going
though all the menus defined by all the plugin.xml files and producing
something at the end of the day. In a similar fashion &#8220;org.eclipse.ui&#8221;
goes through and finds all the &#8220;views&#8221; that a user could add to the
screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-features-work">
<h3>How features work<a class="headerlink" href="#how-features-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Above we saw how plugins can be run resulting in an eclipse
application. For very small projects you may want to do just that ...
get a pile of plugins together and hit &#8220;run&#8221;.
When projects get a bit larger it is useful to gather a group of
plugins together to make this a bit easier to manage.</p>
<p>The idea is that a feature gathers up plugins that together make one
concept or capability available to the user.
As a human visible concept features are the subject of update sites,
or can be reviewed in the help menu if the user wants to know what is
installed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-products-work">
<h3>How products work<a class="headerlink" href="#how-products-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Products are just that; something packaged up and ready to go! You can
actually export them as a stand alone application. You have a couple
of options when defining a product; you can do so using plugins. Or
for larger projects that you expect to last a while or get updated you
should define it using features.</p>
<p>Consider a product as an Eclipse rcp app that is ready to go; you can
define it as a set of plugins (good for small projects) or using
features.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="plugins-vs-features-fight">
<h3>Plugins vs Features fight<a class="headerlink" href="#plugins-vs-features-fight" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>So this is where we get into the thick of it.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>plugins are going to do their best to run; but will refuse to run if
not everything they need is available</li>
<li>features can be used to gather up plugins into groups for distribution</li>
</ul>
<p>And who is responsible for making sure that the features actually
gather plugins into groups that can run?
You!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-about-update-site">
<h3>What about update site<a class="headerlink" href="#what-about-update-site" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You can use an update site to publish features for download; since
features are a group of plugins this is primary the way to distribute
additional functionality to applications that are in the field. You
can also of course use it to distribute updates or patches to existing
features.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-did-we-miss">
<h3>What did we miss<a class="headerlink" href="#what-did-we-miss" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The following concepts are not used that often:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fragments are like half a plugin; they are used to patch an existing
plugin. At a technical level this is done by mixing the plugin.xml
from both the original plugin and the fragment together.</li>
</ul>
<p>We used to have a fragment for each language supported by uDig.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Removing stuff; you can also get a bit fancy and ask the platform to
ignore parts of the plugin.xml document (this can be used to strip
menus or views out of another plugin if you consider them off topic
for the task at hand). Why doesn&#8217;t skip the classes? Well because you
may have subclassed them for your own work .. so the normal Java code
reuse still needs to be respected.</li>
<li>Classloader hell - the OSGi plugin system is mean - it loads plugins
into different class loaders and only lets you work with code that you
have explicitly told it you depend on!</li>
<li>Execution Environment - OSGi has started talking about the target
environment and giving it a name (so you can tell the difference
between Java 5 and Java 6). This is mostly used so a plugin can say
it requires Java 6 (so OSGi won&#8217;t accidentally load it when running on
an older mac where only Java 5 is available).</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-to-fix-it">
<h2>How to fix it?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-fix-it" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you go to run and the application won&#8217;t start; open up your run
configuration and &#8220;validate plugins&#8221; - it will list any plugins that
could not run.
You will need to see why they could not run (ie what they are missing)
and make sure to add anything missing to your application.</p>
<p>If you are running as plugins there is a button to add anything
missing in one easy step.</p>
<p>If you are running as features you will need to sort through what is
missing and decide what feature to include it in. You may also be able
to reuse one of the features already defined as part of the eclipse
platform.</p>
